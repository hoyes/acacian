eaACN has been built using GCC and Gnu Make and run on 
a variety of desktop and embedded Linux systems, however OS 
dependencies have been kept out of the main code files as much as 
possible.

Note that while the C99 standard 
is widely implemented and many compilers, including GCC adhere to it 
fairly well, there are some features of C99 used which were not 
present in earlier standards and Microsoft's compilers in particular 
may not implement them or may have a non-standard equivalent.
