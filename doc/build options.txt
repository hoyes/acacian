title: Options for building ACN

There are quite a number of compile time options for building ea-ACN. 
Some of these make very significant improvements in code size or 
performance in specific cases.

Your local build configuration is defined in "local_cfg.h" which 
overrides the default values for any options you need to change.

"local_cfg.h" is then included in "acncfg.h" which is included 
(usually indirectly via "acncommon.h") in virtually every source 
file. Do not edit "acncfg.h" itself unless adding completely new 
options to the code.

Note: Configuration options are always defined to something - 
usually either to 0 or to 1. This means they should be tested using 
#if... rather than #ifdef...

group: Main Options

about: Local components. CONFIG_SINGLE_COMPONENT

In many implementations, there is just one local component which is 
tighly bound to ea-ACN and may be statically defined. However, some 
applications may implement multiple local components on the same 
ea-ACN instance. If CONFIG_SINGLE_COMPONENT is set, than code for 
tracking multiple local components is omitted and a lot of 
simplifications can be made.

about: Client protocols. CONFIG_RLP_SINGLE_CLIENT, CONFIG_SDT_SINGLE_CLIENT

In an implemntation where SDT is the only protocol using RLP, or where 
DMP is the only protocol using SDT, then checking of protocols used in 
payload PDU blocks can be hard-coded. However, where multiple client 
protocols operate (e.g. both SDT and E1.31 are clients of RLP) then the 
corresponding CONFIG_xxx_SINGLE_CLIENT must be set false to enable 
separate registrations for individual client.

Note, at present (March 2011), DMP is the only publicly defined 
client for SDT and the code for multiple clients is incomplete.

about: DMP functionality. CONFIG_DMP_DEVICE, CONFIG_DMP_CONTROLLER

These two options are not mutually exclusive and both are enabled by 
default, but if one is disabled then code for that functionality is 
omitted. Disabling both options makes no sense and is forbidden.
