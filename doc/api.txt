eaACN API
==========

Application code must first create and initialize a local component 
structure. If eaACN has been compiled with CONFIG_SINGLE_COMPONENT 
there can only be one local component, but this must nevertheless be 
initialized. Initialization allocates the component ID (UUID) to the
component and performs other initialization as necessary.

int init_Lcomponent(Lcomponent_t *Lcomp, cid_t cid)

Return value: 0 on success, -1 on failure.
