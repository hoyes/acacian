<Algorithm for address search> describes the strategy used by the 
generic address map search and mentions the worst case of testing 
for a match against an arbitrary multi-dimensional sparse array 
which is `self-interleaved` as can be defined quite easily in 
DDL/DMP. This page describes the algorithm used for that test.

calculation:

Testing address A for a match with property P. For P the base 
address is specified, then for each array dimension in P there is an 
increment and element count. Does A match an element of P?
 
A property has an arbitrary number n of dimensions Dₖ for 0 ≤ k ≤ n we
call these D₀, D₁ ... Dₖ ... Dₙ each of 
which is specified by an increment I₀ ... Iₖ ... Iₙ and a count. For the 
algorithms here we will use the range limit instead of the count. R (= 
count - 1) thus the maximum inclusive value of property address P due to 
dimension i is Pmax_i = Pbase + Rₖ.Iₖ.

A generic member of the array P is Px where

|  (1)  Px = Pbase + x₀.I₀ + x₁.I₁ + ... + xₙ.Iₙ

For n = 0 we have a single point property and the test is trivial

|  (2)  A ≡ Pbase (or A - Pbase ≡ 0)

For n = 1 we have a linear array, but if increment I₀ > 1 then there 
are holes so we need to know whether (A - Pbase) is an integer 
multiple of I₀. The simplest test is to use the modulus

|  (3) (A - Pbase) mod I₀ ≡ 0

For higher dimensions testing becomes more complex. The range of P 
is given by

|  (4)  Pbase ≤ P ≤ Pbase + I₀.R₀ + I₁.R₁ + ... + Iₙ.Rₙ

Now recalling (1) we want to test A ≡ Px ? but we do not know the 
values for x₀, x₁ etc. Iterating through all x₀, x₁, x₂ etc is not
practicable for large arrays. In most cases increments and counts 
are chosen such that there is no overlap between dimensions (in a 
two dimensional case this is the same as saying that one row does 
not interleave with the next or previous). However there is no 
guarantee that this isn't the case. What we do know though provides 
limits on x₀ — xₙ.

First by subtracting Pbase from all calculations we can simplify so

|  (5)  Ao = A - Pbase

Assume A is in P then for some valid set of x₀ — xₙ

|  (6)  Ao ≡ x₀.I₀ + x₁.I₁ + ... + xₙ.Iₙ

Solving for an individual xₖ

|  (7)  xₖ.Iₖ ≡ Ao - (x₀.I₀ + x₁.I₁ + ... [miss out xₖ.Iₖ] ... + xₙ.Iₙ)

The largest value possible of xₖ for a given Ao is when all other x 
are zero and the bracketed term in (7) becomes zero

|  (8)  xₖ_largest ≡ Ao/Iₖ

but we know that xₖ ≤ Rₖ so for a given Ao and for each dimension 
the top limit for xₖ we will call Tₖ

|  (9)  Tₖ = minimum(Rₖ, Ao/Iₖ)

We can now calculate Tₖ for each dimension. Now using (7) again what 
is the smallest for xₖ? this will occur when all other x are at 
their maximum, but we have now calculated those maxima T₀ — Tₙ. So

|  (10)  xₖ_smallest = (Ao - (T₀.I₀ + .. [miss out Tₖ.Iₖ] .. + Tₙ.Iₙ))
|                      ----------------------------------------------
|                                           Iₖ

but we also know that xₖ ≥ 0 so this gives us the bottom limit on 
xₖ which we call Bₖ

|  (14)  Bₖ = maximum(0, xₖ_smallest)

We have now established for a test value A, a restricted range of 
indexes which we should test for each dimension to see whether A is 
in P.
We can choose one arbitrary dimension, then iterating over all 
possible values from Bₖ to Tₖ for all the other dimensions, 
rearranging (7) and using the modulus test for integral factors our 
test becomes

|  (15) (Ao - (x₀.I₀ .. [miss kth term] .. xₙ.Iₙ)) mod Iₖ ≡ 0

repeated for all possible xₖ: Bₖ ≤ xₖ ≤ Tₖ

The process of calculating Bₖ and Tₖ for each dimension may seem onerous
but in realistic arrays it hugely reduces the search space. However, 
it is possible to optimize further

If the array is non-overlapping, the value of Bₖ and Tₖ come out  
identical for the outermost dimension (the one with the largest 
increment Iₖ) incdicating that this dimension need not be iterated 
at all. This must be so because in a non-overlapping array there is 
only one possible span of the lesser dimensions within which Ao 
could occur. Having established this value, we now know that we can 
fix it and update the calculations for the remaining dimensions but 
with the fixed value for the outermost. If the array is overlapping 
(self-interleaved), we may find the outermost dimension does not 
reduce to a single span to be searched, but nevertheless, 
substituting the values for Tₖ and Bₖ into the equations above 
reduces the range to search within other dimensions further.

Generalising this principle, if the dimensions are sorted so they 
are tested in order from outermost (largest increment) to innermost 
(smallest increment), instead of the declaration order which is 
arbitrary, the search reduces to the smallest possible range.
