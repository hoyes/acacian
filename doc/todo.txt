Test SDT much more thoroughly
  Many bugs have been detected and removed, but there will be more

Build DDL resolver
  See doc/DDL.txt for how this should work. TFTP is already present, or 
  easily added  in many platforms.

Complete DDL parser
  Strategy is outlined in doc/DDL.txt and the parser has had initial 
  testing but needs completion and extension.

Complete DMP property mapper
  See doc/DMP.txt for algorithms.

Test DMP

Port to other platforms
  This is not a high priority - it is better to get a solid base 
  working on a specific POSIX platform before putting a lot of effort 
  into porting. OpenACN suffered from porting to many platforms in a 
  half-baked way. For these purposes GCC/Linux is considered to be a 
  single platform and testing so far has been done on both embedded 
  uClinux on a 32-bit big-endian Coldfire board, and on a 64-bit 
  little-endian SMP Linux desktop.

Rename identifiers and sources to acn_xxx or similar to avoid 
conflict when included with other code.
