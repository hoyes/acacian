macros: PDU flags

Flags for PDU flag and length field

These flags apply to the complete 16-bit flags and length field

LENGTH_FLAG  - Set if length > 4095 (can never be set if epi20 used)
VECTOR_FLAG  - if set vector is present
HEADER_FLAG  - if set header is present
DATA_FLAG    - if set data is present
LENGTH_MASK  - mask off flags leaving length
FLAG_MASK    - mask off length leaving flags

Sometimes we just want to apply flags to the first octet

LENGTH_bFLAG  - 8-bit equivalent of LENGTH_FLAG 
VECTOR_bFLAG  - 8-bit equivalent of VECTOR_FLAG 
HEADER_bFLAG  - 8-bit equivalent of HEADER_FLAG 
DATA_bFLAG    - 8-bit equivalent of DATA_FLAG   
LENGTH_bMASK  - 8-bit equivalent of LENGTH_MASK 
FLAG_bMASK    - 8-bit equivalent of FLAG_MASK
